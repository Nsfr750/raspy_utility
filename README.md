## üöÄ Features

- Modern PySide6-based GUI with dark/light theme support
- Complete GPIO control interface with visual feedback
- Daily log rotation with log viewer
- System tray integration
- Multi-language support
- Command buttons for bulk GPIO operations
- Real-time status updates
- Cross-platform compatibility

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/raspy-utility.git
   cd raspy-utility
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For Windows (without RPi.GPIO):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
   ```

## üõ† Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the interface to control GPIO pins:

   - Toggle individual pins with the GPIO buttons
   - Use "Start All" to set all GPIOs to HIGH
   - Use "Stop All" to set all GPIOs to LOW
   - Use "Reset" to reset all GPIOs and clear the log

3. Access logs:

   - Click on "View Logs" in the menu
   - Select a log file from the dropdown
   - Filter logs by level if needed

## üìù Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory with daily rotation. Each log file is named `raspy_utility_YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
