# Project Roadmap

## High Priority
- [x] Implement modern PySide6 GUI with dark/light theme support
- [x] Add integrated web server for remote access
- [x] Improve GPIO simulator and hardware detection
- [ ] Add support for I2C/SPI devices

## Medium Priority
- [x] Refactor menu system and navigation
- [x] Improve error handling and user feedback

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for analog inputs with ADC
- [ ] Implement data logging and export functionality

## Completed 
- Modern PySide6-based GUI with theme support
- Integrated web server with REST API
- Real-time GPIO status visualization
- Multi-language support (English/Italiano)
- System tray integration
- Improved error handling and logging
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements

## Known Issues
- GPIO simulator may have minor timing issues in certain scenarios
- Web interface performance can be improved on low-end devices
- Some menu items may need better error handling

## Future Considerations
- Add support for more hardware platforms
- Implement OTA updates
- Add user authentication for web interface
- Support for custom widgets and plugins
- Integration with home automation systems
